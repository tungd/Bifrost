# Bifrost

Menubar application to provide proxy to various services through SSH.

# Why

Sometimes I need a Sock5 proxy to get through BS, and I already have some VPS
running around. The other time I have some services running on VPS that I want
to tunnel to my machine so that I can use them as-if they were running locally,
and I'm too lazy to keep a terminal tab open for each of those service.

# How

Bifrost sits on your menubar, and read your `~/.ssh/config` for list of servers
to connect to. Each time you need a proxy just select the server and enable the
service. There's no step 3â„¢.

Behind the scene, what the app really does is to create a SSH tunnel to your
server, with the correct mapping port-to-port. It is the equivalent of running

    ssh -CN -L <port>:127.0.0.1:<port> <remote_ip>

# Roadmap

- [ ] Kubernetes Pod And Service Discovery
- [ ] Automatic startup
- [ ] Configuration: allow to define new services and servers, without relying
      on =~/.ssh/config=. We might need this since currently we're not sandbox
      friendly
- [ ] Logging console
- [ ] AppStore release
